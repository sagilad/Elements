**Elements - Find your own Element**

The Wu Xing, also known as the Five Elements or Five Phases is a fivefold conceptual scheme that many traditional Chinese fields used to explain a wide array of phenomena, from cosmic cycles to the interaction between internal organs, and from the succession of political regimes to the properties of medicinal drugs. 
The "Five Phases" are:
Wood (木 mù), 
Fire (火 huǒ), 
Earth (土 tǔ), 
Metal (金 jīn), 
and Water (水 shuǐ). 

In this app you can find your own dominant Elements in a 125 questionnaire.
